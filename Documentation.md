## ARC Branding - Logo, colors, font and icons
The ARC logo was designed with the ability to adapt to the infinite spectrum of possible designs for wearable items. It is color friendly and built with the robustness of the technical world merged with the edgelessness of the art world. 
The [font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo+2) is direct, edgy, but slightly curved. The colors bold, but structured in a natural sequence. It is meant to describe the infinite posibilities of what you can see in a mirror, and the imagination that follows when that mirror is combined with the technical posibilites of augmented reality.

The main color theme of the logo is worked around a blue shade. The rainbow color scheme was chosen in a split complementary manor, based on two light shades, one of blue and on of green.
