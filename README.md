# ARC - Augmented Reality Clothing (Tryout)

ARC is a project that aims to refresh the user experience when it comes to shopping for wearable items. It is an augmented reality platform which scanes your body and then lets you tryout various wearable items in real time.
ARC aims to be able to:
- Determine a digital copy of the scanned person
- Determine body shape/type
- Determine the binary sex of the user
- Determine body asymetry of various components
- Determine demographic and social context (age, education, personal style etc)
- Ofer a filtering framework, adaptable to any possible properties (wearing context - casual/formal/sport, time windows - weather/season/hour of the day, available budget, colors, textures, materials etc)
- Render the user wearing the item based on the previously mentioned features.

ARC is a proof-of-concept project to showcase different design techniques learned during the [Human Computer Interaction](https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~busaco/teach/courses/hci/) course.
