				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p> Tyler Clements is a young man who is a software developer. He has no time to lose, and is usually in a hurry. Until now, he hated buying clothes because had to spend a lot of time in queues and had to test fit everything he thought fits him, with mixed results. </p>
				<p> He also has troubles with measuring his sizes. Three from his last five orders had to be returned because he bought them in frustration. His friends cannot help him, his preferences are not easy to understand. Moreover, his deepest desire is to be in with the current fasion trend. To chose a propper outfit, no matter how the weather is and how his friends are dressed. He would like to buy clothes more often, but does not have the necesary patience to do so.                
                </p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="personaScenarios">
			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<p>The user visits an augmented reality enabled phisical store. He directly goes into a fitting room. Based on his phone and its internal sensors, the user gets authenticated, and, taking into account the current season, weather, user body type, body sizes and his personal preferences for clothes, various outfits and pieces of clothing are presented to him on a mirror like, human sized touch screen. He then chooses what he likes and the display renders him already wearing what he choosed.</p>
            <p>
            Based on the render, he thinks the item he is trying out will be way to tight, so by adjust a few sliders he makes the item a little bit less firm. The item is rendered in real time, while he is turning to his side to see the item from multiple angles.
            </p>
            <p>
            The user likes how the item fits him, so he decides to buy one for his size. He presses the buy button, and a few days later the item is delivered to his doorstep.

			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<p>The user wants to buy a folk costume. He does not know the local language, therefore he visits an augmented reality enabled phisical store. He directly goes into a fitting room. Based on his phone and its internal sensors, the user gets authenticated, and, taking into account the user body type, body sizes and his personal preference for folk costumes, various outfits and pieces of clothing are presented to him on a mirror like, human sized touch screen. He then chooses what he likes from the clothes physicaly available in the store and the display renders him already wearing what he choosed.</p>
            <p>
            Based on the render, he thinks the item he is trying out will be way to tight, so by adjust a few sliders he makes the item a little bit less firm. The item is rendered in real time, while he is turning to his side to see the item from multiple angles. He also tries to guess the cloth quality by the way it folds around his arms.

            The user likes how the item fits him, so he decides to buy one for his size. He presses the buy button and a staff member will get his order as fast as possible.
