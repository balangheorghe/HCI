				<h5>Overall Objectives</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>User is able to login using the android application</li>
                    <li>User is able to set his preferences</li>
                    <li>User is able to select a cloth</li>
                    <li>User is able to customize the selected cloth</li>

                    <li>User is able to order the cloth</li>

		<div class="usabilityTestScenarios">
			<h5>Scenario</h5>
			<p>The user visits an augmented reality enabled phisical store. He directly goes into a fitting room. Based on his phone and its internal sensors, the user gets authenticated, and, taking into account the current season, weather, user body type, body sizes and his personal preferences for clothes, various outfits and pieces of clothing are presented to him on a mirror like, human sized touch screen. He then chooses what he likes and the display renders him already wearing what he choosed.</p>
            <p>
            Based on the render, he thinks the item he is trying out will be way to tight, so by adjust a few sliders he makes the item a little bit less firm. The item is rendered in real time, while he is turning to his side to see the item from multiple angles.
            </p>
            <p>
            The user likes how the item fits him, so he decides to buy one for his size. He presses the buy button, and a few days later the item is delivered to his doorstep.

					<li>Read the user the scenario for the test;</li>
					<li>Read the user the tasks he has to complete. If the tasks are complex, you may want to put a sheet of paper in front of the user with each task written out;</li>
					<li>Record the user's actions, comments, questions, and body language (write them in the Test Observations section accompanied by video/audio).</li>
					<li>Don't offer help; let the user attempt to perform the task. If they ask for help reply with: "What do you think you/that would do?" "What do you think that means?".</li>

			<h5>Scenario</h5>
			<p>The user wants to buy a folk costume. He does not know the local language, therefore he visits an augmented reality enabled phisical store. He directly goes into a fitting room. Based on his phone and its internal sensors, the user gets authenticated, and, taking into account the user body type, body sizes and his personal preference for folk costumes, various outfits and pieces of clothing are presented to him on a mirror like, human sized touch screen.

            Based on the render, he thinks the item he is trying out will be way to tight, so by adjust a few sliders he makes the item a little bit less firm. The item is rendered in real time, while he is turning to his side to see the item from multiple angles. He also tries to guess the cloth quality by the way it folds around his arms.

            The user likes how the item fits him, so he decides to buy one for his size. He presses the buy button and a staff member will get his order as fast as possible.

            It is a normal work day. Toma arrives early at the shop. He starts the augmented reality system and makes sure that everything is up-to-date and works fine. While the hours passes the number of clients increases. Out of nowhere, an agry client arrives. He is not happy with the received products and wants to return them. Toma has to advise the client and to fill the return forms. He also, has to notify the development team to investigate the issue.

				<h5>Tasks</h5>
					<p>Write out the tasks for each persona type. <strong>Avoid complex tasks.</strong> Make sure the user is able to complete the test in the specified time interval. Assign an estimated completion time for each task.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>User downloads and installs the ARC Android Application - 1 minute</li>
                        <li>User performs a login using his google account - 1 minute</li>
                        <li>User logouts and logins as guest - 1 minute</li>
                        <li>User scans the Room NFC and is being rendered - 1 minute</li>
                        <li>User sets his preferences regarding the clothes - 2 minutes</li>
                        <li>User navigates between available clothes and select the favourite one - 2 minutes</li>
                        <li>User requests a suggested outfit - 2 minutes</li>
                        <li>User visualizes a render of the cloth on himself - 1 minutes</li>
                        <li>User tries another clothes - 2 minute</li>
                        <li>User decides what cloth to buy - 2 minutes</li>
                        <li>User proceeds to the cart section, places the order and finalize the command - 3 minutes</li>
					</ul>
					<p>A user might complete a task in a shorter or greater time than the <strong>estimated time</strong>. If the <strong>completion time</strong> exceeds the estimated time then it there is a problem. Also a user might skip the current task thus the <strong>completion time</strong> would be <strong>0</strong>. </p>
